# MicroControlers
c++ code development, with focus just in the methodology that i have learn "in the streets"
  - Design with focus in parallelism of jobs, application of Finite State Machine
  - Use of flags and/or triggers
  - Use a constant time of execution in the loop (time of superloop)
  - Separation of functions by a layered model (start with the hardware inputs(physical signals) and end with response of the system in hardware output(physical signals))

*Disclaimer: nothing is specific for diferents rules, nothing personal*
